VEED: Customized Transitions Hider

This Chrome extension automatically removes selected transition cards from the VEED editor. It is useful when you do not want to see certain built-in transitions in the list. The extension runs on page load and also watches for VEED re-renders, so the removed transitions stay hidden.
